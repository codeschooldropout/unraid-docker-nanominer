<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I use this on Unraid but not with it's built in docker system due to issues with mounting single files into images.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Install plugins via Community Applications in Unraid

* [Unraid - Nvidia Driver](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/98978-plugin-nvidia-driver/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo somewhere on your array - i.e. /mnt/user/appdata/docker-nanominer.git

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/codeschooldropout/docker-nanominer.git
   ```

2. Deploy via command line since Unraid interface can't handle files?

    ```sh
    docker run --privileged -it --name='docker-nanominer' --runtime=nvidia -p '8081:8081' -v ${PWD}/config_satori_merged.ini:/nanominer/config.ini codeschooldropout/docker-nanominer
    ```
